# Arrays

Arrays are a data structure that store a collection of elements, typically of the **same type**, in **contiguous memory locations**. In programming languages, arrays are usually indexed by a **zero-based** integer, starting from **0**. The size of an array is fixed and determined when the array is created, and the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing for **fast access** to any element in the array.

In many programming languages, arrays have a time complexity of **O(1)** for accessing an element at a specific index, making them a fast and efficient data structure for storing and accessing collections of elements. However, inserting or deleting an element in the middle of an array requires moving all elements after the **insertion** or **deletion** point, resulting in a time complexity of **O(n)** for these operations.

```rs
Index: 0  1  2  3  4
Value: 1  2  3  4  5
```

The first element in the array has an index of `0` and a value of `1`, the second element has an index of `1` and a value of `2`, and so on.

```rs
let mut arr: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

println!("First element: {}", arr[0]);

arr[0] = 6;

println!("Array after modification: {:?}", arr);
```

## Arrays have several weaknesses and limitations

1. Fixed size: Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed. This means that if you need to insert or delete elements in the middle of the array, you need to create a new array with the updated size and copy the elements from the old array.

```rs
let mut arr: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// The following line will cause a compile-error, as the size of the array is fixed and cannot be changed
arr.push(6);
```

1. Slow insertion and deletion: Inserting or deleting an element in the middle of an array requires shifting all the elements after the insertion or deletion point, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

```rs
let mut arr: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// The following operation requires shifting all elements after the insertion point, resulting in a time complexity of O(n)
arr.insert(2, 6);

println!("Array after insertion: {:?}", arr);
```

1. Wasteful with memory: Arrays can become wasteful with memory if elements are inserted or deleted frequently, as the array must be constantly resized and reallocated in memory.

```ts
let mut arr: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// The following operation requires resizing the array and reallocating memory, which can be wasteful if performed frequently
arr.insert(2, 6);

println!("Array after insertion: {:?}", arr);
```

1. Limited to homogeneous data: Arrays can only store elements of the same type. If you need to store elements of different types, you need to use an alternative data structure such as an object or a map.

```rs
// The following line will cause a compile-error, as arrays can only store elements of the same type
let arr: [i32, String];
```

1. No built-in search: Arrays do not have a built-in search function, so you need to write your own search algorithm or use a different data structure if you need to search for elements in the array.

```rs
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// The following code performs a linear search through the array, which has a time complexity of O(n)
let mut found = false;
for i in 0..arr.len() {
    if arr[i] == 3 {
        found = true;
        break;
    }
}

println!("Found: {}", found);
```

## Working with arrays

Here are some common operations when working with arrays:

1. Initialization: Arrays can be initialized with a fixed size or dynamically resized. For example:

```rs
let arr: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let mut dynamic_arr = Vec::new();
dynamic_arr.push(1);
dynamic_arr.push(2);
dynamic_arr.push(3);
dynamic_arr.push(4);
dynamic_arr.push(5);
```

1. Accessing elements: Elements in an array can be accessed by index. For example:

```rs
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

println!("The first element is: {}", arr[0]);
println!("The third element is: {}", arr[2]);
```

1. Iteration: Arrays can be easily iterated over with a for loop. For example:

```rs
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for element in arr.iter() {
    println!("{}", element);
}
```

1. Insertion: Elements can be inserted into an array by index. This operation has a time complexity of O(n) for arrays and O(log n) for dynamic arrays. For example:

```rs
let mut arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// The following operation requires shifting all elements after the insertion point
arr.insert(2, 6);

println!("Array after insertion: {:?}", arr);
```

1. Deletion: Elements can be deleted from an array by index. This operation also has a time complexity of O(n) for arrays and O(log n) for dynamic arrays. For example:

```rs
let mut arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// The following operation requires shifting all elements after the deletion point
arr.remove(2);

println!("Array after deletion: {:?}", arr);
```

1. Search: Elements can be searched for in an array with a linear search algorithm. This operation has a time complexity of O(n). For example:

```rs
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// The following code performs a linear search through the array
let mut found = false;
for i in 0..arr.len() {
    if arr[i] == 3 {
        found = true;
        break;
    }
}

println!("Found: {}", found);
```
