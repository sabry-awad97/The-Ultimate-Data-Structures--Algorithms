# Big O Notation: The Ultimate Guide

Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the behavior of an algorithm as the size of its input grows. It provides an upper bound on the number of operations an algorithm takes in the worst case scenario. This is an important metric because it helps software engineers understand how their algorithms perform and make decisions on which algorithms to use for a particular task.

The notation consists of a function, f(n), and a constant, O(g(n)), that bounds it. For example, an algorithm with time complexity O(n) means that the number of operations it takes grows linearly with the size of its input, n.

Here is a list of common time complexities and their corresponding Big O notation:

- O(1): **Constant time complexity**, meaning the number of operations remains the same regardless of the size of the input.

```rs
fn get_first_element(arr: &[i32]) -> &i32 {
    &arr[0]
}
```

- O(log n): **Logarithmic time complexity**, meaning the number of operations grows logarithmically with the size of the input.

```rs
fn binary_search(arr: &[i32], target: i32) -> Option<usize> {
    let mut left = 0;
    let mut right = arr.len() - 1;

    while left <= right {
        let mid = (left + right) / 2;

        if arr[mid] == target {
            return Some(mid);
        } else if arr[mid] < target {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    None
}
```

- O(n): **Linear time complexity**, meaning the number of operations grows linearly with the size of the input.

```rs
fn print_array(arr: &[i32]) {
    for element in arr {
        println!("{}", element);
    }
}
```

- O(n log n): **Log-linear time complexity**, meaning the number of operations grows as the product of the size of the input and the logarithm of the size of the input.

```rs
fn merge_sort(arr: &mut [i32]) {
    if arr.len() <= 1 {
        return;
    }

    let mid = arr.len() / 2;
    let left = &mut arr[..mid];
    let right = &mut arr[mid..];

    merge_sort(left);
    merge_sort(right);

    let mut i = 0;
    let mut j = 0;
    let mut k = 0;

    while i < left.len() && j < right.len() {
        if left[i] < right[j] {
            arr[k] = left[i];
            i += 1;
        } else {
            arr[k] = right[j];
            j += 1;
        }
        k += 1;
    }

    while i < left.len() {
        arr[k] = left[i];
        i += 1;
        k += 1;
    }

    while j < right.len() {
        arr[k] = right[j];
        j += 1;
        k += 1;
    }
}
```

- O(n^2): **Quadratic time complexity**, meaning the number of operations grows as the square of the size of the input.

```rs
fn bubble_sort(arr: &mut [i32]) {
    for i in 0..arr.len() {
        for j in 0..arr.len() - i - 1 {
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1] {
                arr.swap(j, j + 1);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- O(2^n): **Exponential time complexity**, meaning the number of operations grows exponentially with the size of the input.

```rs
fn fibonacci(n: i32) {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n;
    }

    fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```
