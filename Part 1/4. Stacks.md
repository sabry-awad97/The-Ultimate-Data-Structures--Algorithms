# Stacks

```rs
use std::vec::Vec;

struct Stack<T> {
    elements: Vec<T>,
}

impl<T> Stack<T> {
    fn new() -> Stack<T> {
        Stack { elements: Vec::new() }
    }

    fn push(&mut self, element: T) {
        self.elements.push(element);
    }

    fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<T> {
        self.elements.pop()
    }

    fn peek(&self) -> Option<&T> {
        self.elements.last()
    }
}
```

## What are the common interview questions around stacks ?

Here are some common interview questions related to stacks:

1. Explain what a stack is and how it works.

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

Imagine a stack of plates. You can only add a plate to the top of the stack, and you can only remove the plate that is on the top of the stack. This is similar to how a stack data structure works. The top of the stack is the end where elements are added and removed, and the bottom of the stack is where the first element was added and will be the last to be removed.

1. What are the main operations that can be performed on a stack?

   - The main operations that can be performed on a stack are:

     - `Push`: This operation adds an element to the top of the stack.

     - `Pop`: This operation removes the top element from the stack and returns its value.

     - `Peek`: This operation returns the value of the top element of the stack without removing it.

     - `is_empty`: This operation returns a boolean value indicating whether the stack is empty or not.

     - `size`: This operation returns the number of elements currently in the stack.

1. What is the difference between a stack and a queue?

   | Feature           | Stack                    | Queue                     |
   | ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
   | Order of elements | Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) | First-In-First-Out (FIFO) |
   | Main Operations   | push, pop                | enqueue, dequeue          |
   | Element addition  | Top of the stack         | Back of the queue         |
   | Element removal   | Top of the stack         | Front of the queue        |

1. Can you explain the concept of a stack overflow and a stack underflow in computer science?

   A stack overflow occurs when there is no more space in the stack to add new elements, and an attempt is made to push a new element onto the stack. This error can occur when the size of the stack is limited and the number of elements pushed onto the stack exceeds that limit.

   A stack underflow occurs when an attempt is made to pop an element from an empty stack. This error can occur when all elements have been popped from the stack, but an attempt is still made to pop one more element.

   Both stack overflow and stack underflow can lead to serious problems in a program, such as crashes or unexpected behavior. To avoid these errors, it is important to implement proper error handling and to track the size of the stack, checking it before pushing or popping elements.

1. Can you implement a stack using an array or a linked list?

   Using an array:

   ```rs
    struct Stack<T> {
    elements: Vec<T>,
    size: usize,
    }

    impl<T> Stack<T> {
        fn new() -> Stack<T> {
            Stack {
                elements: Vec::new(),
                size: 0,
            }
        }

        fn push(&mut self, element: T) {
            self.elements.push(element);
            self.size += 1;
        }

        fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<T> {
            if self.size == 0 {
                return None;
            }

            self.size -= 1;
            Some(self.elements.pop().unwrap())
        }

        fn peek(&self) -> Option<&T> {
            if self.size == 0 {
                return None;
            }

            Some(&self.elements[self.size - 1])
        }

        fn size(&self) -> usize {
            self.top
        }
    }

   ```

   Using Linked List

   ```rs
    use std::ptr;

    struct Node<T> {
        element: T,
        next: Option<Box<Node<T>>>,
    }

    struct Stack<T> {
        head: Option<Box<Node<T>>>,
    }

    impl<T> Stack<T> {
        fn new() -> Stack<T> {
            Stack { head: None }
        }

        fn push(&mut self, element: T) {
            let new_node = Box::new(Node {
                element,
                next: self.head.take(),
            });
            self.head = Some(new_node);
        }

        fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<T> {
            self.head.take().map(|node| {
                let node = *node;
                self.head = node.next;
                node.element
            })
        }

        fn peek(&self) -> Option<&T> {
            self.head.as_ref().map(|node| &node.element)
        }

        fn size(&self) -> usize {
            let mut count = 0;
            let mut current = &self.head;
            while let Some(node) = current {
                count += 1;
                current = &node.next;
            }
            count
        }
    }
   ```

1. Write code to reverse a string using a stack.

   ```rs
   use std::collections::VecDeque;

   fn reverse_string(input: &str) -> String {
       let mut stack = VecDeque::new();
       for c in input.chars() {
           // add characters to the end of the stack
           stack.push_back(c);
       }
       let mut result = String::new();
       // remove the top element from the stack
       while let Some(c) = stack.pop_back() {
           result.push(c);
       }
       result
   }

   fn main() {
       let input = "hello";
       let result = reverse_string(input);
       println!("{} reversed is {}", input, result);
   }
   ```

1. What are some real-world examples of using a stack?

   - Web browser history: The stack data structure is used to keep track of the history of pages visited in a web browser. The most recently visited page is stored at the top of the stack, and the oldest page is at the bottom. When you click the "back" button, the current page is popped off the top of the stack and the previous page is displayed.

   - Expression evaluation: Stacks are used in expression evaluation, such as evaluating arithmetic expressions written in postfix notation using the reverse Polish notation (RPN) method. The operands are pushed onto the stack, and when an operator is encountered, the two most recent operands are popped off the stack, the operation is performed, and the result is pushed back onto the stack.

   - Algorithm design: Stacks are used in the design of many algorithms, including backtracking algorithms, where elements are pushed onto the stack as the algorithm progresses and popped off the stack when the algorithm needs to backtrack.

   - Recursion: Recursive algorithms often use a stack to keep track of the function call order. Each time a function is called, its parameters and current state are pushed onto the stack. When the function returns, the state is popped off the stack and the previous state is restored.

   - Parsing: Stacks are used in parsing, including parsing of HTML and XML documents, where elements are pushed onto the stack as the document is being parsed and popped off the stack as the document is processed.

   - Compiler syntax parsing: Compilers use stacks to parse and interpret programming language syntax. For example, when parsing a block of code, the compiler pushes the block onto the stack and pops it off when the block is finished.

   - Memory management: Stacks are often used in memory management to keep track of function call frames. Each time a function is called, a new call frame is created and pushed onto the stack, and the call frame is popped off the stack when the function returns.

1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a stack?

   - Advantages of using a stack

     - Efficient access to the last element
     - Simple and intuitive

   - Disadvantages of using a stack

     - Limited access to elements other than the last one
     - Slow access time to elements other than the last one

1. Write a function to check if a given expression has balanced parentheses using a stack.

   ```rs
   use std::collections::VecDeque;

   fn is_balanced_expression(expression: &str) -> bool {
       let mut stack = VecDeque::new();

       for char in expression.chars() {
           match char {
               '(' | '[' | '{' => stack.push_back(char),
               ')' => {
                   if let Some(&last) = stack.back() {
                       if last != '(' {
                           return false;
                       }
                       stack.pop_back();
                   } else {
                       return false;
                   }
               },
               ']' => {
                   if let Some(&last) = stack.back() {
                       if last != '[' {
                           return false;
                       }
                       stack.pop_back();
                   } else {
                       return false;
                   }
               },
               '}' => {
                   if let Some(&last) = stack.back() {
                       if last != '{' {
                           return false;
                       }
                       stack.pop_back();
                   } else {
                       return false;
                   }
               },
               _ => (),
           }
       }

       stack.is_empty()
   }
   ```

   ```rs
   use std::collections::Vec;

   pub fn brackets_checker(symbols: &str) -> bool {
       let mut stack = Vec::new();
       let opening_brackets = "([{";
       let closing_brackets = ")]}";
       let mut balanced = true;
       let mut index = 0;

       while index < symbols.len() && balanced {
           let symbol = symbols.chars().nth(index).unwrap();
           if opening_brackets.contains(symbol) {
               stack.push(symbol);
           } else {
               if stack.is_empty() {
                   balanced = false;
               } else {
                   let top = stack.pop().unwrap();
                   if opening_brackets.find(top) != closing_brackets.find(symbol) {
                       balanced = false;
                   }
               }
           }
           index += 1;
       }
       balanced && stack.is_empty()
   }
   ```

1. Can you implement a queue using two stacks?

   Yes, it's possible to implement a queue using two stacks. The idea is to use one stack as the main container for elements and another stack as a temporary storage.

   ```rs
   use std::collections::VecDeque;

   struct Queue<T> {
       enqueue_stack: VecDeque<T>,
       dequeue_stack: VecDeque<T>,
   }

   impl<T> Queue<T> {
       fn new() -> Self {
           Queue {
               enqueue_stack: VecDeque::new(),
               dequeue_stack: VecDeque::new(),
           }
       }

       fn enqueue(&mut self, value: T) {
           self.enqueue_stack.push_back(value);
       }

       fn dequeue(&mut self) -> Option<T> {
           if self.dequeue_stack.is_empty() {
               while let Some(value) = self.enqueue_stack.pop_back() {
                   self.dequeue_stack.push_back(value);
               }
           }

           self.dequeue_stack.pop_back()
       }
   }
   ```

1. Write a function to convert a number to a binary representation using a stack.

   ```rs
   use std::collections::Vec;

   fn convert_binary(number: i32) -> String {
       let mut stack = Vec::new();
       let mut n = number;
       let mut result = String::new();

       while n > 0 {
           stack.push(n % 2);
           n /= 2;
       }

       while let Some(d) = stack.pop() {
           result.push_str(&d.to_string());
       }

       result
   }
   ```

1. Write a function to convert a number to a target base (2, 8, 16) using a stack.

   ```rs
   use std::collections::Vec;

   fn convert_base(number: i32, base: i32) -> String {
       let mut stack = Vec::new();
       let mut n = number;
       let mut result = String::new();
       let digits = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";

       while n > 0 {
           stack.push(n % base);
           n /= base;
       }

       while let Some(d) = stack.pop() {
           result.push(digits.chars().nth(d as usize).unwrap());
       }

       result
   }
   ```
