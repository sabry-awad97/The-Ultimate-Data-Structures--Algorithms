# Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the list. Linked lists are dynamic data structures, which means that their size can be changed at runtime.

In linked lists, elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations like arrays. Instead, each node has a data element and a pointer to the next node in the list. The last node in the list has a `null` pointer, indicating the end of the list.

## Weaknesses and limitations of linked lists

1. **Dynamic allocation**: Linked lists use dynamic allocation to store data, which can be slow compared to arrays that use contiguous memory allocation. Additionally, dynamic allocation can lead to memory fragmentation over time, making it difficult to allocate large blocks of contiguous memory. A potential example of the slow speed of dynamic allocation is when a linked list needs to grow dynamically and allocate more memory. Each time memory is allocated, the program needs to find a block of free memory that is large enough, which can take time and slow down the program.

1. **Searching**: Searching for an element in a linked list is O(n) time complexity, meaning it can be slow for large linked lists. In contrast, searching for an element in an array is O(1) time complexity if you know the index. An example of slow searching in a linked list is finding a specific element in a linked list with 10,000 nodes. To find the desired node, the program would have to traverse the entire list, taking O(n) time.

1. **Insertion and deletion**: Linked lists have a constant time complexity for inserting or deleting elements at the beginning of the list, but O(n) time complexity for inserting or deleting elements anywhere else in the list. In contrast, inserting or deleting elements in an array requires shifting all elements after the insertion or deletion point, resulting in O(n) time complexity in the worst case. An example of the slower insertion and deletion in linked lists compared to arrays is inserting a node into the middle of a linked list with 1,000 nodes. To insert the node, the program would have to traverse the list and update the next pointers for each node, taking O(n) time.

1. **Space overhead**: Linked lists have a space overhead compared to arrays because each node in the linked list must store both the data and a reference to the next node. This means that linked lists are less memory efficient than arrays, especially for small data sets. An example of the space overhead of linked lists compared to arrays is storing a list of 1,000 integers. In a linked list, each node would need to store both the integer and a pointer to the next node, while in an array, the integers can be stored contiguously without any additional overhead.

1. **Random access**: Linked lists do not provide random access to elements, meaning you must traverse the list to access a specific element. In contrast, arrays provide constant time access to elements by index. An example of the difficulty in random access with linked lists is needing to access the 500th node in a linked list with 1,000 nodes. To access the node, the program would have to traverse the first 499 nodes, taking O(n) time.

1. **Recursion**: Recursive algorithms are more difficult to implement with linked lists than with arrays, as it is not as straightforward to access elements in a linked list by index as it is with an array. An example of the difficulty in implementing recursive algorithms with linked lists is computing the sum of all nodes in a linked list. To do this, the program would have to traverse the linked list and add up all the values, which is more complicated than simply accessing elements in an array by index.

## Working with linked lists

1. **Creating a linked list**: Creating a linked list involves allocating memory for the nodes of the list and linking the nodes together to form a list.

1. **Inserting a node**: Inserting a node into a linked list involves updating the next pointers of the surrounding nodes to link the new node into the list.

1. **Deleting a node**: Deleting a node from a linked list involves updating the next pointers of the surrounding nodes to remove the node from the list.

1. **Searching for a node**: Searching for a node in a linked list involves traversing the list and checking the value of each node until the desired node is found.

1. **Reversing a linked list**: Reversing a linked list involves updating the next pointers of the nodes so that the order of the nodes is reversed.

1. **Merging linked lists**: Merging two linked lists involves combining the nodes of two separate linked lists into a single linked list.

1. **Sorting a linked list**: Sorting a linked list involves rearranging the nodes of the list so that the values are in a specific order.

## Big O notation of each operation

1. **Creating a linked list**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. This operation requires allocating memory for each node and linking the nodes together, which takes linear time.

1. **Inserting a node**: O(1) for inserting at the head or at the end, O(n) for inserting at the middle, where n is the number of nodes in the list. This operation requires updating the next pointers of the surrounding nodes, which takes constant time if inserting at the head, but linear time if inserting at the end or middle as the list needs to be traversed.

1. **Deleting a node**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. This operation requires updating the next pointers of the surrounding nodes and freeing the memory of the deleted node, which takes linear time.

1. **Searching for a node**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. This operation requires traversing the list and checking the value of each node until the desired node is found, which takes linear time.

1. **Reversing a linked list**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. This operation requires updating the next pointers of the nodes and traversing the list, which takes linear time.

1. **Merging linked lists**: O(n + m), where n and m are the number of nodes in the two lists being merged. This operation requires combining the nodes of two separate linked lists into a single linked list, which takes linear time.

1. **Sorting a linked list**: O(n log n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. This operation requires rearranging the nodes of the list so that the values are in a specific order, which takes logarithmic time for sorting algorithms such as merge sort or quick sort.

## Building a linked list

```rs
struct Node {
    data: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct LinkedList {
    head: Option<Box<Node>>,
    tail: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

impl LinkedList {
    fn new() -> LinkedList {
        LinkedList { head: None, tail: None, size: 0 }
    }

    fn display(&self) {
        let mut current = &self.head;
        while let Some(node) = current {
            println!("{}", node.data);
            current = &node.next;
        }
    }
}
```

### Appending a node to the end of the linked list with the given data

```rs
impl LinkedList {
    fn append(&mut self, data: i32) {
        let new_node = Box::new(Node { data, next: None });
        match self.tail.take() {
            Some(old_tail) => old_tail.next = Some(new_node),
            None => self.head = Some(new_node),
        }
        self.tail = Some(new_node);
        self.size += 1;
    }
}
```

### Appending a node to the front of the linked list with the given data

```rs
impl LinkedList {
    fn prepend(&mut self, data: i32) {
        let new_node = Box::new(Node { data, next: self.head.take() });
        if self.tail.is_none() {
            self.tail = Some(new_node);
        }
        self.head = Some(new_node);
        self.size += 1;
    }
}
```

### Index of method

```rs
impl LinkedList {
    fn index_of(&self, data: i32) -> Option<usize> {
        let mut current = &self.head;
        let mut index = 0;
        while let Some(node) = current {
            if node.data == data {
                return Some(index);
            }
            current = &node.next;
            index += 1;
        }
        None
    }
}
```

    fn length(&self) -> usize {
        self.size
    }
}
```

### Contains method

```rs
impl LinkedList {
    fn contains(&self, data: i32) -> bool {
        self.index_of(data).is_some()
    }
}
```

### Removing the first node in the linked list

```rs
impl LinkedList {
    fn remove_head(&mut self) -> Option<i32> {
        self.head.take().map(|node| {
            let head = *node;
            self.head = head.next;
            if self.head.is_none() {
                self.tail = None;
            }
            self.size -= 1;
            head.data
        })
    }
}
```

### Removing the last node in the linked list

```rs
impl LinkedList {
    fn remove_tail(&mut self) -> Option<i32> {
        if self.head.is_none() {
            return None;
        }
        if self.head.as_ref() == self.tail.as_ref() {
            return self.remove_head();
        }
        let mut node = self.head.as_mut().unwrap();
        while node.next.as_ref().unwrap().next.is_some() {
            node = node.next.as_mut().unwrap();
        }
        node.next.take().map(|node| {
            self.tail = Some(node);
            self.size -= 1;
            node.data
        })
    }
}
```

### Converting linked list to array

```rs
impl LinkedList {
    fn to_array(&self) -> Vec<i32> {
        let mut result = vec![];
        let mut current = &self.head;
        while let Some(node) = current {
            result.push(node.data);
            current = &node.next;
        }
        result
    }
}
```

## Comparison of Arrays and Linked Lists

### In terms of space

| Feature           | Array                                                         | Linked List                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Fixed Size        | Yes                                                           | No                                              |
| Memory Allocation | Contiguous                                                    | Non-contiguous                                  |
| Memory Usage      | Can waste memory if size is not utilized fully                | No waste of memory, uses exactly what is needed |
| Access Time       | Constant time                                                 | Linear time                                     |
| Dynamic Sizing    | Can grow with dynamic arrays but requires reallocating memory | Can easily grow or shrink as needed             |

In summary, arrays are suitable for scenarios where random access to elements and fast access to elements at a specific index is required, while linked lists are better suited for scenarios where frequent insertion and deletion of elements is required.

### In terms of runtime complexities

| Operation                                | Array            | Linked List |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Accessing an element at a given index    | O(1)             | O(n)        |
| Inserting an element at the beginning    | O(n)             | O(1)        |
| Inserting an element at the end          | O(1) (amortized) | O(1)        |
| Inserting an element at a specific index | O(n)             | O(n)        |
| Removing an element at the beginning     | O(n)             | O(1)        |
| Removing an element at the end           | O(1) (amortized) | O(n)        |
| Removing an element at a specific index  | O(n)             | O(n)        |

It can be seen from the table that arrays have faster runtime complexities for accessing elements and inserting elements at the end. On the other hand, linked lists have faster runtime complexities for inserting elements at the beginning and removing elements from anywhere in the list.

## Types of linked lists

1. **Singly linked list**: A type of linked list where each node has a single pointer to the next node. This type of linked list is used when you need to traverse the list in a single direction.

1. **Doubly linked list**: A type of linked list where each node has two pointers, one to the next node and one to the previous node. This type of linked list is used when you need to traverse the list in both forward and backward directions.

1. **Circular linked list**: A type of linked list where the last node points back to the first node, creating a circular chain. This type of linked list is used when you need to traverse the list multiple times.

1. **Skip list**: A type of linked list where each node has multiple pointers to other nodes, skipping some of the intermediate nodes. This type of linked list is used when you need to search for elements in a list more efficiently.

## Reversing a linked list

```rs
use std::mem::swap;
impl LinkedList {
    fn reverse(&mut self) {
        let mut prev = None;
        let mut current = self.head.take();
        let mut next = None;

        while let Some(mut node) = current {
            next = node.next.take();
            node.next = prev;
            prev = Some(node);
            current = next;
        }

        self.head = prev;
        self.tail = current;
    }
}
```

## Kth node from the end

```rs
fn kth_from_end(&self, k: usize) -> Option<i32> {
    let mut slow = &self.head;
    let mut fast = &self.head;
    for _ in 0..k {
        match fast {
            Some(node) => fast = &node.next,
            None => return None,
        }
    }
    while fast.is_some() {
        slow = &slow.as_ref().unwrap().next;
        fast = &fast.as_ref().unwrap().next;
    }
    Some(slow.as_ref().unwrap().data)
}
```
